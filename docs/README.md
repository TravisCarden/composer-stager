Composer Stager makes long-running Composer commands safe to run on a codebase in production by "staging" them--performing them on a non-live copy of the codebase and syncing back the result for the least possible downtime.

<!-- @todo Remove warning once there's a stable release. -->
## Warning!

Composer Stager is in the very early stages of development and _highly_ unstable. Unless you are part of the PHP-TUF development team, do not use it.

## Composer library

The Composer library is installed, of course, via Composer:

```shell
composer require php-tuf/composer-stager
```

It is invoked via its PHP API. Given a configured service container that supports autowiring (e.g., [Symfony's](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html)) its services can be used like the following, for example:

```php
class Updater
{
    public function __construct(
        BeginnerInterface $beginner,
        StagerInterface $stager,
        CommitterInterface $committer,
        CleanerInterface $cleaner
    )
    {
        $this->beginner = $beginner;
        $this->stager = $stager;
        $this->committer = $committer;
        $this->cleaner = $cleaner;
    }

    public function update(): void
    {
        $activeDir = PathFactory::create('/var/www/public');
        $stagingDir = PathFactory::create('/var/www/staging');

        // Copy the codebase to the staging directory.
        $this->beginner->begin($activeDir, $stagingDir);

        // Run a Composer command on it.
        $this->stager->stage([
            'require',
            'lorem/ipsum',
            '--update-with-all-dependencies',
        ], $stagingDir);

        // Sync the changes back to the active directory.
        $this->committer->commit($stagingDir, $activeDir);

        // Remove the staging directory.
        $this->cleaner->clean($stagingDir);
    }
}
```
