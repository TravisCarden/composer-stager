     *   The directory to sync files from, as an absolute path or relative to the

     * @param string $destination
     *   The directory to sync files to, as an absolute path or relative to the
     *   current working directory (CWD), e.g., "/var/www/destination" or
     *   "destination". If it does not exist it will be created.
     * @param string[]|null $exclusions
     *   An array of paths to exclude, relative to the source directory. Absolute
     *   paths are silently ignored. The destination directory is automatically
     *   excluded in order to prevent infinite recursion if it is a descendant of

     *   An optional PHP callback to run whenever there is process output.

     *   An optional process timeout (maximum runtime) in seconds. Set to null
     *   to disable.
     *
     * @throws \PhpTuf\ComposerStager\Exception\DirectoryNotFoundException
     *   If the source directory is not found.
     * @throws \PhpTuf\ComposerStager\Exception\IOException
     *   If the destination directory cannot be created.
     * @throws \PhpTuf\ComposerStager\Exception\ProcessFailedException
     *   If the command process doesn't terminate successfully.
